<p>By Signing in to our application, Good Thought, or using our application, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the application into other languages, or make derivative versions. The application itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to us.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are committed to ensuring that the application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the application or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the application or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Good Thought application stores and processes personal data that you provided us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the application secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Good Thought application won’t work properly or at all.</p>

<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that We will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the application will require the application to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but We cannot take responsibility for the application not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
